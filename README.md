**Ground** is an iOS app for tracking your progress on the
[Groundhandling Challenge](https://www.groundhandlingchallenge.com/) from Andre Bandarra.

## Install

At present, the app is still under development and has not been released on the
App Store. If you want to try the app before its release, you can run it in the
simulator or on a personal device. Running the app on a device requires [an
Apple Developer account](https://developer.apple.com/). Add your developer id to
`Project.swift` for [automatic code
signing](https://developer.apple.com/support/code-signing/) and make sure that
the certificate is trusted on the device.

To get started:

1. Install the latest Xcode (presently [Xcode 12 beta](https://developer.apple.com/download/))
1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and [Tuist](https://tuist.io/docs/usage/getting-started/)
1. Run `tuist up` to set up the project
1. Run `make` to generate and then open the project
